DB configuration:
{
  _id : "..." <- this is automatically set,
  date : "the blog post's date of posting" <- shouldn't be in plain text... but fuck it i can do it later,
  tags : ["a", "list", "of", "tags"],
  blogTitle : "the-blogs-porper-URL-title",
  content : {
    title : "The blog's title",
    content : "<p>This is going to be the post's html content</p>"
  }
}

===================================

Plan of attack
--------------

Homepage: will display links to all the blog posts in reverse chronological order
(most recent posts first)

/new-post :
- this is the page where the content creation will occur. This page may only be
accessible if I am logged in.

1. Once logged in, I may go to this page and start writing.
  1*. There will be an h1 at the top and this is the content's "title"
  1**. inside ".content" is where the html blog post content will go.

2. When finished writing, you can submit by clicking a "submit button"

3. Upon submission, index.js must grab all required information and inputs it
  all in the database

4. Redirect to the homepage
